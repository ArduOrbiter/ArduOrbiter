ArduOrbiter
===========

The software running on ArduOrbiter-1 is the file called 'Disk3.ino'.

The numbers after 'DiskX.ino' represent the major overhauls. For example, 'Disk2.ino' is the major overhaul of 'Disk1.ino'.

All the hardware will be tested in vacuum chambers and shakers. They will also be exposed to the extreme temperatures. If it still works, we will push for a launch.
